# InternshipHub — NTU SC2002 OOP Project

InternshipHub is an internship application management system developed for  
**Nanyang Technological University (NTU)** as part of the **SC2002: Object-Oriented Programming** course.

The system supports **Students**, **Staff**, and **Company Representatives** with features such as internship creation, approval workflows, application management, and persistent data storage.  
The architecture is designed using **Object-Oriented principles** and fully adheres to **SOLID design principles**.

## How to View Javadoc

Javadoc has already been generated inside the `/doc` folder.

To view it:

1. Open the project folder
2. Navigate to:

```
doc/index.html
```

3. Double-click `index.html`
4. Your browser will open the full documentation site
   (methods, classes, inheritance, descriptions)

If you need to regenerate Javadoc manually, use:

```bash
javadoc -d doc -sourcepath src -subpackages careerhub
```

## Folder Descriptions

### **src/careerhub/**

The full Java source code is structured using OOP layering

### **data/**
Contains CSV data to initialise the program:
* `students.csv`
* `staff.csv`

After running the program, it also contains all saved CSV data that persists all the states:
* `users.csv`
* `internships.csv`
* `applications.csv`

If any file is missing, the system automatically boots with **fresh seed data** from `students.csv` and `staff.csv`.

### **Diagrams/**

All UML diagrams required:
* Class Diagram
* Sequence Diagrams

### **doc/**

Autogenerated Javadoc site.
Open `doc/index.html` to browse.

### **Report/**
Contains the written project report
